# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, July 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp's Tribute page and began the Portfolio page.

**Thoughts:** Struggled a little bit with the Bootstrap CSS on the Tribute page getting things to look the way I wanted. Was able to push through that on the thumbnail look. Starting the get the hang of it but still got a ways to go.
