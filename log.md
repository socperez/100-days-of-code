# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, July 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp's Tribute page and began the Portfolio page.

**Thoughts:** Struggled a little bit with the Bootstrap CSS on the Tribute page getting things to look the way I wanted. Was able to push through that on the thumbnail look. Starting the get the hang of it but still got a ways to go.

### Day 2: Tuesday, July 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the portfolio challenge from freecodecamp.

**Thoughts** It's been cool getting familiar with Bootstrap design and how to harness it. Navigating how much I should be making my own CSS edits vs. Bootstrap. This page is taking longer than I anticipated but I feel like I'm making progres.
